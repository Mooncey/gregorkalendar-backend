# Setup
1. Install Python (if not already installed)
2. Set up a virtual environment in the repository folder by running `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To initialize the database, run `python init_db.py`
To run the app locally, run `python app.py`

If you add more packages using pip install, update the requirements.txt by
doing `pip freeze >> requirements.txt`
